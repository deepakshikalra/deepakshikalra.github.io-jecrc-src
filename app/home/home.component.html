 <p style="text-align:justify;">In this fast pacing world running behind the power of technology, there is a loss of awareness of Self and the Supreme power. The meaning of life has changed its definition from happiness to luxury. A pious place is created in JECRC to rejuvenate and re-establish the lost definition of Self and broken connection with the Supreme. It has a sound proof ‘Meditation Room’ developed as silence zone for meditation and self-contemplation. It also includes a Spiritual Library, with collection of best selling spiritual and inspirational books. Regular classes are conducted in Wisdom Hall which is designed as a smart classroom. A Research Laboratory for conducting research on meditation is equipped with EEG, EMG, Karadascan, Aura Scanning and other health monitoring devices. Mr. Mukesh Agarwal, Ms. Chitra Khandelwal and Ms. Aakanksha Desai are providing insight for the accomplishment of objectives of the Spiritual Cell.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meditation is the journey inwards, a journey of self-discovery or, in fact, re-discovery. Meditation is time taken for quiet reflection and silence, away from the hustle and bustle of daily living. Taking time out enables us to come back to a centred place of being. In our modern world, the pace of life is growing ever faster and we are losing touch with our true inner peace and power. When we no longer feel grounded, we can experience ourselves pushed and pulled in many different directions. It is at this point that we start to experience stress and a feeling of being trapped. Gradually, over time, this feeling leads to illness and disease, as our mental, emotional and physical health is thrown out of balance. Raja Yoga meditation is a form of meditation that is accessible to people of all backgrounds. It is a meditation without rituals or mantras and can be practised anywhere at any time. Raja Yoga meditation is practised with ‘open eyes', which makes this method of meditation versatile, simple and easy to practice. Meditation is a state of being in that place just beyond every day consciousness, which is where spiritual empowerment begins. Spiritual awareness gives us the power to choose good and positive thoughts over those which are negative and wasteful. We start to respond to situations, rather than just reacting to them. We begin to live with harmony, we create better and happier, healthier relationships and change our lives in a most positive way.</p>
